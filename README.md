## Challenge Overview
This challenge required us to become familiar with using dependencies, loading CSV files, creating and writing .txt files to establish our database, analyze and finalize results.

## Challenge Summary
We looked at the raw data provided by the counties. Using Python in VS Code, we created a code that would count each vote for each candidate. This would allow us to determine the total votes therefore percentage of votes for each candidate, and determine the winner of the election who was candidate Diane DeGette. Diane won the election with 73.8% or 272,892 votes.
